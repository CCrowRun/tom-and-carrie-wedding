			<h2>Driving Routes</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-8">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>From the East</h3>
					<p>	
						Due to Indiana highways, the main route to Madison is on I-80/I-90W.
						The roads do include tolls, which would benefit from an I-Pass or EZPass.
						Typically traffic is at its worst around Chicago.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>From the South</h3>
					<p>
						Unless you intend to stop in Chicago, if you are able to avoid the city you will avoid a majority of traffic.
						Taking I-39 North to Rockford could cut a large amount of time - typically traffic is limited that direction.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>From the West</h3>
					<p>
						We have driven a number of routes from the West, and have found they are generally fairly similar.
						If you intend to stop along the way, we have recommendations in particular for Minneapolis, MN; Des Moines, IO; and Cedar Rapids IO.
